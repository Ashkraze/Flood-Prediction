Flood Prediction Model 

In this project, I developed a flood prediction model using a Linear Regression algorithm. The primary focus was on thorough data engineering with several critical steps:

Outlier Treatment: Identifying and handling outliers to ensure data quality.
Standardization: Transforming data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Scaling: Adjusting the range of data features to a standard scale.
Normalization of Output Variable: Ensuring the output variable follows a normal distribution.

After preparing the data, I employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This process helped in identifying the optimal hyperparameters, enhancing the modelâ€™s performance and accuracy.
